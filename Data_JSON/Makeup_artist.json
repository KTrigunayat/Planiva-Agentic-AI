Now, assistants aren’t really a concern, the concern is that one cannot be sure about how well they have been trained. Also, even the makeup service owner, there is no surety of their calibre as well- it is just that they have been in service for a while and people have visited them, posted good reviews too maybe or they are just supposed to be the best in the local area. But, does that guarantee that the work done by them will be up to the satisfaction. Azmi Glitz Makeup Artistry based out of Bangalore is the perfect answer to all such concerns.",
