When run with the `--debug` flag, the scraper saves additional files in a `debug` directory:

- `rendered_page.html`: The final rendered HTML of the page
- `extracted_data.json`: Raw JSON data extracted from the page
- `js_extracted_data.json`: Data extracted using JavaScript execution
- `*.log`: Error and processing logs

## Customization

To modify the scraper for different websites or to extract additional data:

1. Update the `_process_venue_data` method to handle different data structures
2. Modify the XPath/CSS selectors in `_extract_json_from_page` if the page structure changes
3. Add new methods to extract additional information as needed

## Limitations

- The scraper is specifically designed for WedMeGood's website structure
- May require updates if the target website changes its structure
- Rate limiting or IP blocking may occur with excessive requests
